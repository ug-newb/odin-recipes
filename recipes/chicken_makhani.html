    <h1>Chicken Makhani (Indian Butter Chicken)</h1>
    <img src="../image.png" alt="butter chicken photo">
    <p>This butter chicken recipe, or chicken makhani, is one of my favorite Indian dishes. 
        It features a full-flavored sauce that complements the chicken well. It can be made 
        as mild or spicy as you wish by adjusting the cayenne. Serve with basmati rice and naan
         bread.
